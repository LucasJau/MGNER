Instructions for updating:
Use tf.cast instead.
2019-08-21 17:34:31,525:WARNING: From C:\Users\suning\Desktop\New_Project\My_Work\MGNER\Multi-Grained-NER-master\classifier\cls_model\ner_model.py:147: calling dropout (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) with keep_prob is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `rate` instead of `keep_prob`. Rate should be set to `rate = 1 - keep_prob`.
